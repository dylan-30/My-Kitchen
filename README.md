# Your-Kitchen 
This is a project for the creation of a SQL database created in order to manage the orders of an online website that sells the principal electronic components for
the kitchen.
We stored information about the inventory, account of the customers, and orders.

# Queries
We performed some simple queries on the database, for example the registered accounts that haven't bought anything yet, or the emails that use "gmail" as a webmail service, and so on.

# Ontology
You can also find the ontology of our database, with classes, object properties and data properties description.
